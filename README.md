## Project Description
As devices and systems to test get smaller, large power supplies with their fans are often not required. The "Battery PWR Board" is a small board that can supply 5.0 amd/or 3.3 Volts. In the typical case is two 3032 coin batteries may all that's required but it can run also from a 9 volt battery ot a wall wart. The one LED on board is on when the 5.0 volt rail is in valid limits. Guaranting the batteries are ok. 

### Project Status
The project is basically complete.
