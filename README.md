## Project Description
As systems and devices to test get smaller, large power supplies with their fans are often not required. The "Battery PWR Board" is a small board that can supply 5.0 amd/or 3.3 Volts. In a typical case two 3032 coin batteries may all that's required. The board can also run from a 9 volt battery or a wall wart. The on board PWR_OK LED is on when the 5.0 volt rail is within valid limits. Guaranting the batteries are ok. Since it can run from batteries and there is no active switching devices on board it is very low noise. 

### Project Status
The project is basically complete.
